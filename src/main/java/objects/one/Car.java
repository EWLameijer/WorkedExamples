package objects.one;

// Create a car with a brand (String), year of manufacture, Color (you can use and extend if needed our general
// Color enum class in this package), and
// kilometersDriven (double). The first two are fixed at creation time, while kilometersDriven is set at 0.0 at
// object creation time.
// All these values should be able to be 'gotten' from the car, but we don't want regular setters.
// For the color, we don't want a setColor, but a givePaintjob(Color newColor)
// For the kilometersDriven: we just drive the car, (drive(double distance)) driving it [even backwards!
// https://www.quora.com/Can-you-drive-a-car-backwards-to-take-miles-off-it ] will increase the kilometersDriven
